Project Description:
	We built a text editor that allows users to create and save
.txt files. When you save a file, you save it with a commit 
message. You can choose to pull up previously saved versions of 
your file. The previously saved versions are displayed with their
commit messages. An additional feature of our text editor is 
spell-check. You press the "spell check" button on the bottom
and it displays the misspelled words in the file, together with
10 suggested words for each of them.

Breakdown:
Sandor - GUI
Felicia - Git style version control
Eitan - Spell-check

Project Used:
	- Data structures and (some) of the files they were used in: 
		HashMap (SpellChecker.java)
		ArrayList (SpellChecker.java)
		PriorityQueue as max-heap (SpellChecker.java)
		Tree (MyFileTree.java)
	- Java Graphics:
		Controller.java
	- Interfaces:
		TODO
	- Design patterns:
		Singleton (GitDatabase.java)
		MVC (with Controller.java being both view and controller)
		Big ball of mud (just kidding!!!)
