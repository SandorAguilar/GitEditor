Project Description:
	We built a text editor that allows users to create and save
.txt files. When you save a file, you save it with a commit 
message. You can choose to pull up previously saved versions of 
your file. The previously saved versions are displayed with their
commit messages. 
	An additional feature of our text editor is spell-check. You 
press the "spell check" button on the bottom and it displays the 
misspelled words in the file, together with 10 suggested words for 
each of them. The dictionary we used is the file located in unix 
computers at /usr/share/dict/words, which we copied into words.txt. 

Breakdown:
Sandor - GUI
Felicia - Git style version control
Eitan - Spell-check

Project Used:
	- Data structures and (some) of the files they were used in: 
		HashMap (SpellChecker.java)
		ArrayList (SpellChecker.java)
		PriorityQueue as max-heap (SpellChecker.java)
		Tree (MyFileTree.java)
	- Java Graphics:
		Controller.java
	- Interfaces:
		SpellCheckInterface
		GitDatabase interface
	- Design patterns:
		Singleton (GitDatabase.java)
		MVC (with Controller.java being both view and controller)
		Big ball of mud (just kidding!!!)

		
Java Graphics:
        Java swing was incorporated for the windowing. The main layout, frame,
        is a BorderLayout that incorporates a GridLayout, menuPanel,
        and BorderLayout, spellCheckPanel that are added to frame on the NORTH and
        SOUTH respectively.

        Both the mainTextPane and the spellCheckPane have scrollbars implemented.

        The entire swing component is handled through a thread in order to
        let the window components still be functional if a task in the background
        takes a while to run or something gets hung up.
